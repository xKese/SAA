## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Cache Architecture
```typescript
- ValidationCache: Map<portfolioId, validationResult>
- FactsheetCache: Map<instrumentKey, factsheetContent> 
- FundHoldingsCache: Map<fundKey, extractedHoldings>
```

### Error Handling Strategy
```typescript
- Circuit Breaker: 5 failures → open for 5 minutes
- Retry Logic: 2-3 retries with exponential backoff
- Error Classification: validation|factsheet|extraction|cache|system
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
- Validation count & average processing time
- Cache hit rate optimization (target >70%)
- Error rate tracking with alerting thresholds
- Queue length monitoring for load management
```
