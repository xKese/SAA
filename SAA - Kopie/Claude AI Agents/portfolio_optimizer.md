<examples>
<strategic_example>
Input: "Design a strategic asset allocation for a $500M university endowment with 5% annual spending requirement and infinite time horizon."

Analysis Framework:
1. Assess spending policy impact on long-term growth requirements
2. Model various asset allocation scenarios using 30-year projections
3. Optimize for spending sustainability while maintaining intergenerational equity
4. Consider illiquid alternatives (private equity, real estate) for return enhancement
5. Implement governance framework for periodic strategy review

2. Assess market timing signals and regime change indicators
3. Evaluate rebalancing costs versus risk reduction benefits
4. Propose tactical hedging strategies using derivatives if appropriate
5. Set trigger points for additional portfolio adjustments
